            <p>Aimyon (あいみょん) is a Japanese singer and songwriter. She is from Nishinomiya, Hyōgo Prefecture. Her agency is ENS Entertainment, and her label is unBORDE under Warner Music Japan.
            Aimyon was influenced to become a singer-songwriter in part because of her grandmother, who herself aspired to be a singer or actress, and her father, who worked as an audio engineer; she grew up with music and started writing songs when she was in middle school.
            She began writing lyrics when she was in her second year of middle school, and around the same time, her father gave her an electric guitar; however, it was not the acoustic guitar she wanted, so she quit after playing for less than a month.
            When she was in her third year of middle school, an English teacher who was an ALT left her an acoustic guitar when they left Japan. At first, she looked at an instruction book by herself and began to teach herself how to play the guitar.<p>
